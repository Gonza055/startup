# Notes on Git and GitHub

## What I Learned

### Setting Up a Repository
- Created a GitHub account.
- Initialized a new repository with a README file.
- Cloned the repository to my local machine.

### Git Basics
- Learned to add and commit changes using VS Code.
- Pushed changes to GitHub.
- Pulled changes made directly on GitHub's web interface to my local environment.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
- Created a file named `conflictTest.md` and observed changes on both GitHub and my local setup.
- Intentionally induced a merge conflict.
- Learned how merge conflicts are presented in VS Code and successfully resolved them.

### The Evolution of Hosting:
- While I initially thought hosting a server off my laptop was a possibility, I quickly understood its limitations. It's not just about making a device accessible online; it's about security, availability, and scalability. This experience made me appreciate the services that cloud providers like AWS offer.

### The Scale of the Web:
- Learning about data centers, I was reminded of the enormity of the internet. It's easy to forget that behind every website, there's a physical machine in a massive, controlled environment, serving data to millions.

### Delving into AWS:
- AWS was an enlightening exploration. The platform's flexibility in server location, instance types, and more, showcased the customization cloud providers offer to cater to diverse needs. The ever-changing interface of AWS, however, was a reminder of the tech industry's rapid evolution.

### The Triumph of First Connection:
- Seeing my server go live for the first time was an indescribable feeling. It solidified the idea that with the right tools and guidance, anyone could contribute to the vast landscape of the web.

### Understanding Secure Access:
- SSH-ing into my server was more than a command; it was a lesson in security and the importance of safeguarded access in the digital age.

### Importance of IP Consistency:
- The concept of Elastic IPs introduced me to the balance of cost, accessibility, and reliability. How ensuring a consistent point of access (like a persistent IP) can play a vital role in user experience.

### Power vs. Cost:
- Selecting the server size taught me to strike a balance between performance and cost. While it's tempting to scale up, sometimes optimization and effective resource use can lead to better outcomes.

## HTML Tweaks

- Swapped navigation `div`s for `a` tags, linking to BYU and FamilySearch.
- Adjusted `ul` text to list "apples", "bananas", and "oranges".
- Added an `img` to `aside` with a defined width.
- Inserted a row in the table with entries: "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript".
- Added "ChatGPT" within an `h1` in the `header`.
- Placed a GitHub repository link in the `footer`.

## Takeaways

- `a` tags facilitate navigation to pertinent web pages.
- The `ul` element efficiently lists items using `li` tags.
- The `width` attribute in `img` controls the display size.
- Tables use `tr`, `th`, and `td` for rows, headers, and data respectively.
- `h1` to `h6` tags structure content for readability and SEO.
- Footer often contains important links or credits.

## Reminders

- Secure rights for image and content use.
- Choose meaningful `alt` text for images, enhancing accessibility.
- Employ semantic HTML for structured and accessible content.

## CSS Styling Endeavor
Styling plays a pivotal role in any application, dictating its overall appearance and user experience. With this activity, I explored the following:

- **Ambient Backgrounds**: Introduced images to add depth and context to each page, enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Element Styling**: Experimented with various CSS properties to achieve desired layouts and designs.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the site looks and functions well across devices of varying screen sizes.
- **Debugging**: Utilized browser developer tools to troubleshoot styling issues, a key tool in any developer's arsenal.

## Takeaways
- Images can drastically change the feel and tone of a page.
- Responsiveness is not just a bonus but a necessity in the modern web.
- Proper debugging can save hours of frustration and lead to better outcomes.

## Future Notes
I'll continue to add more notes as I explore deeper aspects of Git and software development.
