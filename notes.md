# Notes on Git and GitHub

## What I Learned

### Setting Up a Repository
- Created a GitHub account.
- Initialized a new repository with a README file.
- Cloned the repository to my local machine.

### Git Basics
- Learned to add and commit changes using VS Code.
- Pushed changes to GitHub.
- Pulled changes made directly on GitHub's web interface to my local environment.

### Handling Merge Conflicts
- Created a file named `conflictTest.md` and observed changes on both GitHub and my local setup.
- Intentionally induced a merge conflict.
- Learned how merge conflicts are presented in VS Code and successfully resolved them.

## Future Notes
I'll continue to add more notes as I explore deeper aspects of Git and software development.
